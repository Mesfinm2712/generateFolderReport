Run a report of directory structure and the various levels.

to compile: make

to run tree report: ./FSreport -tree pathname
to run inode report: ./FSreport -inode pathname

Notes:

Example of pathname is: home/myname/rootdir/

On the linux system, I tested with my pathname: /home//myname/rootdir/mebea/generateFolderReport/

Tree report is sorted in alphabetical order and inode report is sorted by inode number.

It works for any amount of levels !
